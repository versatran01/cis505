1) when N > 1, thread-based solution is generally faster than process-based solution.
This is because creating processes has more overhead than creating threads.
Another reason is that using multiple processes requires some sort of IPC to share data,
while multiple threads share the same address space.

2) The general trend for base lines is that the timing decreases dramatically at the begining
with respect to the number of processes/threads. But at some point the decrease slows down.
This is because the number of processes/threads reaches the max amount of cores that the CPU
has. After that points, only a few of them can run trully in parallel.
