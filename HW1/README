Extra notes:
  The error handling functions in common.h/common.cpp is from
  the book Linux Programming Interface 3rd.

  There's a simple unit testing included using Catch, which
  is a single header c++ unit testing framework.
  Run `make test` to compile the test and run `./test_main' to
  run the test client.

  Also a python script `test_mysort.py` is included for easily
  generating data and testing the correctness of mysort against
  unix sort.
